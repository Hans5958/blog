This repository hosts my writings/articles that I ever published. It could be anything, whether it is about programming, gaming, or maybe other things that I find interesting.

Some of the literature has been published on other services, but I consolidate them into this single blog.

> This is **generation 3** (v3) of the project. If you want to check the previous generation (generation 2 with Jekyll), check out https://github.com/Hans5958/blog-jekyll.
